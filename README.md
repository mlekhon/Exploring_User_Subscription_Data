# Exploring User Subscription Data: Geographical Mapping and Distribution Analysis

#  Abstract:
In the dynamic landscape of subscription-based services, understanding user behavior and preferences is paramount. This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of user subscription data, offering insights into age, gender, country, device, subscription type, and revenue distribution. Through insightful visualizations and geographical mapping, this report aims to unravel patterns and trends that can guide decision-making for service providers and marketers.

# Introduction:
User subscriptions have become a cornerstone of modern business models. This project analyzes a user subscription dataset to gain valuable insights into user characteristics, preferences, and revenue distribution.

# Data Collection and Preparation:
The dataset comprises user information including User ID, Subscription Type, Monthly Revenue, Join Date, Last Payment Date, Country, Age, Gender, Device, and Plan Duration. Any missing or incomplete data was handled during preprocessing.

# Geographical Mapping:
The geographical distribution of users was visualized using maps to highlight the concentration of subscribers in different countries. The United States is the highest number of Netflix users with the highest revenue generated country.

# Age Distribution Analysis:
The age distribution of subscribers was visualized to uncover patterns in user demographics. The age range between 40-45 is the most viewer age group.

# Gender Distribution Analysis:
The gender distribution among subscribers was analyzed to understand the platform's user base. Both males and females have the same ratio of watching Netflix.

# Country Distribution Analysis:
Visualizing the distribution of subscribers across countries provides insights into the service's global reach. In country distribution, Spain is ranked one country.

# Device Distribution Analysis:
The prevalence of different devices (Smartphones, Tablets, Smart TVs, Laptops) among subscribers was explored through visualization. Among all other devices Laptop is the most used device by Netflix consumers.

# Subscription Type Analysis:
Different subscription types (Basic, Premium, Standard) were analyzed to understand the popularity of each plan. Around 40% of Netflix users are Basic subscribers.

# Revenue Distribution Analysis:
The distribution of revenue generated by different subscription types, countries, and devices was visualized to uncover revenue patterns.

# Conclusion:
Through data analysis and visualization, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of user demographics, subscription preferences, and revenue distribution. These insights can aid service providers and marketers in tailoring their strategies to meet user expectations and maximize revenue.

# Tools and Technologies:

Python for data analysis and visualization (pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
